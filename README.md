## Description
FlashCards is a terminal-based program meant to simulate working through a set of study flashcards on Javascript prototype methods. Users will be prompted with questions and 3 possible answers to choose from. They will be informed of incorrect or correct answers and given a percentage of correct answers at the end of the card deck as well as how many minutes and seconds it took them to complete the deck.

## Technology Used
JavaScript

Testing: Mocha and Chai

## Installation & Setup
- First clone down the repository with `$ git clone`
- Install dependencies with `$ npm install`
- To begin using the program, run `$ node index.js` in your terminal
- Use the up/down arrow keys or the number pad to select your answer
- Press enter to submit your answer and to move onto the next question

## Features
- The card deck begins with a welcome message and then prompts the player with the first question
- After selecting an answer the program lets the player know whether it was correct or incorrect before moving on
- After the end of the round (30 cards), the player will be told that the round has ended and be supplied with the percentage of questions they got correct
- Players will also be informed of how much time it took them to complete the deck at the end in minutes and seconds
